## MSc-Thesis---Higher-Order-Approximation-of-non-linear-SPDE-s with additive space-time white noise
# Abstract
This project serves as a literature review on convergence rates of higher order numerical approximations for
nonlinear reaction–diffusion SPDEs with additive space–time white noise on the one-dimensional torus, and
mainly follows the work in [1]. The main focus is to prove functional bounds of numerical approximations’
convergence rate for two classes of nonlinearities: (i) globally bounded f with bounded derivatives, and (ii)
polynomially growing f under a one-sided Lipschitz condition. In both cases, convergence rates of M−1+ϵ
in time and N−1/2+ϵ in space are proved. The paper also focuses on two theoretical frameworks that are
crucial in the derivations of said results, namely the Stochastic Sewing Lemma and the implementation of
Littlewood-Paley Theory/Besov spaces in analysis.
